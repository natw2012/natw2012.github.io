        <h2>Sparkle</h2>
        <p>
            For the Queen's Engineering Practice course, we were introduced to the low quality of living in the visually impaired community. We were tasked with developing a mobile application that could improve their quality of living. We researched the issue and found that the majority of the visually impaired suffer from isolation and have trouble completing personal care activities. In a team of 4, we developped a range of ideas that could potentially improve their live but decided that an accessible dating app would be the most innovative and beneficial. The dating app was marketed as a less superficial platform, like typical picture based apps, and uses voice-recorded biographies. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The application was made for Android phones, and was developped using the Ionic framework. Ionic uses web languages like HTML, CSS, and JS and can be ported over to multiple platforms.

        <h2>Wooden Bike</h2>
        <p>
            For the Queen's Biomechanical Research Group, in a team of 4, we designed and constructed a prototype for an environmentally friendly bike made out of wood. The project involved full work reports, regular team meetings with and without our project manager, client, and faculty adviser. We completed a SolidEdge model, and conducted an in depth static force analysis of the design. We then built the physical prototype in a wood shop.
